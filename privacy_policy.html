                    <p>AuthEntry LLC strives to comply with all applicable laws around the globe that are designed to protect your privacy. Although legal requirements may vary from country to country, AuthEntry LLC intends to adhere to the principles set forth in this Online Privacy Policy even if, in connection with the above, we transfer your Personal Information from your country to countries that may not require an "adequate" level of protection for your Personal Information. In other words, our goal is to provide protection for your Personal Information no matter where that Personal Information is collected, transferred, or retained.

                    <h2>Collection of Email Addresses</h2>
                    
                     <p>We will never sell your email address.<br />If you opt-in for our version update newsletter or purchase software from us we may send you marketing material. You will be able to unsubscribe at any time.
</p>
                    
                   	 <p>Your email address may be recorded by the software automatically, even if you do not opt-in. In this case we will not send you marketing material (unless you later chose to opt-in on purchase). Use of your email address will be limited to extreme cases such as notifying users of serious bugs in an application or on no more than once for non-marketing product feedback requests.

                     <h2>Collection of Program Usage Data</h2>
                    
                     <p>Our programs may collect anonymous usage data which may be sent back to use for analysis, such as the number of times a menu or option is used within the program. In these cases the data collected will never contain anything that can personally identify you.</p>

                     <h2>Choice</h2>
                    
                     <p>You may choose whether or not to provide Personal Information to AuthEntry LLC. The notice we intend to provide where AuthEntry LLC collects Personal Information on the Web should help you to make this choice. If you choose not to provide the Personal Information we request, you can still visit most of AuthEntry LLC's Web sites, but you may be unable to download or purchase our software. If you chose to have a relationship with us, such as a contractual or other business relationship or partnership, we will naturally continue to contact you in connection with that business relationship.
</p>
                     
                     <p>Wherever your Personal Information may be held within AuthEntry LLC, we intend to take reasonable and appropriate steps to protect the Personal Information that you share with us from unauthorized access or disclosure.

                     <p>AuthEntry LLC does not intend to transfer Personal Information without your consent to third parties who are not bound to act on AuthEntry LLC's behalf unless such transfer is legally required.
